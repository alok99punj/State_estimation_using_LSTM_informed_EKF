# State_estimation_using_LSTM_informed_EKF
This project demonstrates  the use of a physics informed neural network to estimate the state of ground vehicles
The data is generated using matlab-simulink ( A 3DOF bicycle model is considered)
The modules of Extended Kalman Filter and LSTM are implemented 
The PINN is implemented using the LSTM in succession with the EKF 
The results can be verified by the graphs attached
